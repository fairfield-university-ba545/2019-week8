Sometimes we use (k-means) clustering as a pre-modeling step for supervised learning: essentially, we can use k-means clsutering to capture the internal relationship of the features, and then capture the relationship in an additional feature that being used as an input to a classification/regression model.\n",

    "One key step in k-means clustering is to determine the value of `k` - how many clusters? If we want to use the clustering results as an additional (categorical) feature, we should not have a higher value of `k`. Also, increasing value of `k` may increase the erroneous relationship being captured. The k-means model is provided in `sklearn.clustering`.\n",
