    "## Classification Workflow\n",
    "Whenever you perform classification, the first step is to understand the problem and identify potential features and label. Features are those characteristics or attributes which affect the results of the label. For example, in the case of a loan distribution, bank manager's identify customer’s occupation, income, age, location, previous loan history, transaction history, and credit score. These characteristics are known as features which help the model classify customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification has two phases, a learning phase, and the evaluation phase. In the learning phase, classifier trains its model on a given dataset and in the evaluation phase, it tests the classifier performance. Performance is evaluated on the basis of various parameters such as accuracy, error, precision, and recall.\n",

    "## What is Naive Bayes Classifier?\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a statistical classification technique based on Bayes Theorem. It is one of the simplest supervised learning algorithms. Naive Bayes classifier is the fast, accurate and reliable algorithm. Naive Bayes classifiers have high accuracy and speed on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the effect of a particular feature in a class is independent of other features. For example, a loan applicant is desirable or not depending on his/her income, previous loan and transaction history, age, and location. Even if these features are interdependent, these features are still considered independently. This assumption simplifies computation, and that's why it is considered as naive. This assumption is called class conditional independence.\n",

    "- Step 4: See which class has a higher probability, given the input belongs to the higher probability class.\n",
    "For simplifying prior and posterior probability calculation you can use the two tables frequency and likelihood tables. Both of these tables will help you to calculate the prior and posterior probability. The Frequency table contains the occurrence of labels for all features. There are two likelihood tables. Likelihood Table 1 is showing prior probabilities of labels and Likelihood Table 2 is showing the posterior probability.\n",
